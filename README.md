# citeRpackages

Give `citeRpacks()` a list of packages you want to cite, tell it what to name your file, and if you're using RStudio, indicate whether to include an entry for the program (defaults to `FALSE`):

`my_packs <- c("ggplot2", "Hmisc", "base")`

`citeRpacks(my_packs, "mybibfile", RStudio = TRUE)`

To cite R itself, include `"base"` in your package list.

The function will save a .bib file to your working directory, which you can upload to reference managers that accept them for import.

_There's a StackOverflow thread cited in the code that suggests `sink()` may cause issues if you have another package loaded that also uses it. This is the easiest way to get a well-formed .bib file, but run at your own risk._

To export to Endnote format install package "rbibutils": https://geobosh.github.io/rbibutils/ and set `Endnote = T`:

`my_packs <- c("ggplot2", "Hmisc", "base", "rbibutils")`

`citeRpacks(my_packs, "mybibfile", Endnote = TRUE)`

The function will save a .end file in addition to the .bib file to your working directory, which you can import into Endnote.
